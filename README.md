<h1>🟡 Rucman</h1>
Everyone's favorite maze mucher who has absolutely zero likeness to a certain yellow fella.

<h2>How to play⁉️</h2>
Rucman navigates the maze by going directly forward to the direction he's facing.

<h3>🎮 Controls:</h3>
You're only allowed to turn if there's a path in that direction, so make sure to hold or mash the direction you want to turn towards.
<ul>
  <li>W: Points Rucman upwards. ⬆️</li>
  <li>A: Points Rucman to the left. ⬅️</li>
  <li>S: Points Rucman downwards. ⬇️</li>
  <li>D: Points Rucman to the right. ➡️</li>
  
  <li>Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Q ends the game. ❎</li>
</ul>

<h3>➕ Maze:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>. : Are pellets that score 5 points.</li>
  <li>* : Are power pellets that score 10 points and make the ghosts vulnerable for eating.</li>
  <li>The paths that lead outside the maze walls will teleport you to the other side!</li>
</ul>

<h3>👻 Ghosts</h3>
They have no relation to similarly named ghosts, but they do hurt as much as they do!
<ul>
  <li>🔴 Blinky: Represented with a <b>B</b>. Chases directly after Rucman.</li>
  <li>🔵 Inky: Represented with an <b>I</b>. Flanks Rucman in a chase.</li>
  <li>🩷 Pinky: Represented with a <b>P</b>. Aims to cut off Rucman in a chase.</li>
  <li>🟠 Clyde: Represented with a <b>C</b>. Aimlessly wanders the maze. </li>
  <li>When the ghosts are shown with lowercase letters after a power pellet, they're vulnerable! Try to eat them for extra points! But be careful as they won't be vulernable forever!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aside 💗</h3>
This was a project I made to learn Rust. I started with absolutely <i>zero experience</i> with Rust, studied it for a <i>week</i>, and then built this game in a <i>few days</i>. I have progressed a lot 
and quickly but I still have a lot more to learn! If you are an employer reading this, I hope you are willing to support my endeavors in improving my skills.
